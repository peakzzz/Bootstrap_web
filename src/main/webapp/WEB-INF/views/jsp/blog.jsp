		      <p>Big data is a broad term for data sets so large or complex 
		      that traditional data processing applications are inadequate. 
		      Challenges include analysis, capture, data curation, search, 
		      sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, and information privacy. 
		      The term often refers simply to the use of predictive analytics or 
		      other certain advanced methods to extract value from data, and seldom 
		      to a particular size of data set. Accuracy in big data may lead to 
		      more confident decision making. And better decisions can mean greater 
		      operational efficiency, cost reduction and reduced risk.
